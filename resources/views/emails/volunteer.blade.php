Since our launch, the response has been overwhelming. We have increased our supporter-base by tens of thousands, and our activists are now hitting the ground, across the length and breadth of South Africa.

Our growth has exceeded even my expectations. South Africans are taking it upon themselves to set up structures and mobilise communities in support of our cause. This is the true embodiment of the ACTION South Africa needs!

The work of building a credible alternative has begun.

Yours,

Herman Mashaba
